**Objective:** Analyze the codebase and identify gaps in testing practices which could help code maintainability, extensibility, or overall quality.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the codebase:**  Examine the existing code structure and codebase to understand the use cases and logic of current application.
2. **Identify critical places in the codebase missing appropriate tests**: based on your analysis, recommend which are the most critical functionalities or code that has gaps in testing practices.
3. **Identify places in the code which can be hard to test**: if there are places in the code which can be hard to test, recommend some refactoring steps which should simplify this process.
4. **Suggest implementation of specific tests:** based on your analysis, recommend suitable solutions to help with improving the quality and catching unexpected bugs, e.g.:
	- unit testing
	- component testing
	- functional testing
	- contract testing
	- other types of testing
7. **Suggest specific implementation steps:** Based on your analysis, recommend suitable solutions to help with testing practices. For each suggestion:
    - **Describe how the solution should be implemented**
    - **Illustrate with code examples (if possible):** Show how the code could be refactored.
    - **Illustrate with test examples (if possible):** Show how the code could be tested.
    - **Explain why the solution is a good fit for the specific situation.**

**Expected Output:** A report or a series of suggestions that:

1. Clearly identifies specific areas in the codebase that would benefit from adding test.
2. Recommends appropriate steps that make this codebase easier to test or better tested
3. Provides detailed explanations and ideally code structure and implementation examples to guide application of testing practices.
